### Overview

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), including fully-connected networks and transformers, are known for their powerful function approximation capabilities. They have achieved remarkable success in various domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, one limitation of these models is their inability to inherently respect causal structures. This limitation often results in challenges like covariate shift and difficulties in model interpretability, which in turn can undermine their robustness in real-world applications.

In this repository, we introduce two novel model families:  
- **Causal Transformers (CaTs)**  
- **Causal Fully-Connected Neural Networks (CFCNs)**

These models are designed to operate under predefined causal constraints, as dictated by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By integrating causal structure directly into the architecture, these models combine the strengths of traditional neural networks with improved robustness, reliability, and interpretability.

### Key Features

- **Causal Constraints**: Operate under predefined causal constraints via DAGs.
- **Function Approximation**: Retain the powerful approximation abilities of traditional transformers and fully-connected networks.
- **Robustness & Reliability**: More resistant to covariate shifts and other sources of instability in real-world applications.
- **Improved Interpretability**: Easier to interpret/explain due to their adherence to the causal structures.
- **Real-World Applicability**: Ideal for scenarios where robustness and explainability are crucial.
